# Stellar-Atlas

This was my final year project for my Software Design for Engineering Systems degree. It shows the level I reached at that time.
I am rusty now, but I am currently working my way back to this level. 

I hope it shows some of my coding skills and style.

I was unable to get a fully working proramme completed in the time allowed, as the projections from a 3D space to a flat screen representing the night sky 
was much trickier than i had envisioned.
